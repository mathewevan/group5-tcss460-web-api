Alpha Sprint Meetings
Held our first meeting on 4/17 to do the Group Introduction and figure out our schedule for meetings.
Sunday: 8pm-9pm, Monday: 8pm~, Thursday: 8pm-9pm.
Held a short additional meeting on Sunday to determine if needs were met for Alpha sprint. Decuded to forgo the scheduled Monday meeting due to lack of available instruction.
Doing our communication through Discord Server for our Group.

Alpha Sprint Comments
Since the alpha sprint required not too much that could be done outside of the Heroku production setup, that is reflected in our Alpha Sprint Contributions.
